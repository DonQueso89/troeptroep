            <p>The challenge of our time is to prompt collective metanoia so that we become aware.</p>
            <p>Abstinence is a virtue and is healthy for you</p>
            <p>Joy is here and now. In your hands. In your sweat. In our perpetual tragedy. In the ridiculousness and grandness of the fact of our existence.</p>
